                  <h2> Moving to Kansas City</h2>
       <p>At the age of 18, I decided to go to college four hours away from comfort. Although I knew there would be many ups
            and downs in this journey, in the end I knew it would be worth it. On the road trip my mom accompanied me. I knew she was 
            proud of me and I was proud of myself!
